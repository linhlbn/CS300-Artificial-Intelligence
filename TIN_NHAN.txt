The SingleFoodSearchProblem class defines several methods that must be implemented in order to solve the search problem. These methods include:

getStartState(): returns the starting state of the problem
isGoalState(state): returns True if the given state is a goal state (i.e., the state in which the agent has reached the food item), and False otherwise
getSuccessors(state): returns a list of (successor, action, stepCost) tuples, where each successor is a successor state of the given state, action is the action taken to reach the successor state, and stepCost is the cost of taking the action
getCostOfActions(actions): returns the total cost of a sequence of actions
